## Introduction

Machine learning is a powerful tool for solving classification problems, and this repository simplifies the process of training and evaluating machine learning models. It includes support for various classification algorithms, hyperparameter tuning, and data preprocessing.

## Features

- Load data from CSV, Excel, or SQLite databases.
- Automated preprocessing of data, including missing value imputation.
- Support for multiple classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Neural Network, and XGBoost.
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV for model optimization.
- Model evaluation, including accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC curve, and AUC.
- Easily extendable to add more algorithms and preprocessing steps.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sqlite3 (for database loading), and xgboost (if using XGBoost).
